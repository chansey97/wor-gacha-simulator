**Surprise > Crazy > Limited > Regular Spirits**

Limited Invocation of Spirits > Regular Invocation of Spirits: 

The Limited Invocation of Spirits maintains an independent pity system.  When a 5-stars hero is obtained, the shared pity resets, but the  independent pity remains intact. This mechanism makes it superior to the regular Invocation of Spirits.

Crazy Invocation of Spirits > Limited Invocation of Spirits: 

Even with the independent pity system of Limited Invocation of Spirits, it still cannot surpass the Crazy Invocation of Spirits' doubled probability boost for obtaining 5-stars heroes.

## **Optimal Dual-Pool Strategy**

Generally, the Limited Invocation of Spirits is accompanied by another summoning pool (e.g., Invocation of Spirits or Crazy Invocation of Spirits), allowing players to employ the "Dual-Pool Strategy".

Using the Invocation of Spirits as the **secondary pool** example:

Begin summoning in Limited Invocation of Spirits (initial shared pity: 0).

If no 5-stars hero is obtained within X pulls:

- Switch to Invocation of Spirits until obtaining a 5-stars hero
- Return to Limited Invocation of Spirits until obtaining the first limited 5-stars hero

If a 5-stars hero is obtained within X pulls:

- If it's the limited 5-stars hero: Stop
- Otherwise: Continue summoning until obtaining the first limited 5-stars hero

**Choosing X:**

- Low X (early switching):

  Excessive use of the secondary pool fails to leverage the Limited Pool's independent pity, reducing success rate.

- High X (delayed switching): 

  Improves success rate but risks significant losses in worst-case scenarios (e.g., obtaining the limited hero on the 190th pull).

**Optimal X = 133 minimizes the maximum required pulls per 5-stars hero while avoiding worst-case scenarios.**

*P.S. Mathematical derivation:*

Given constraints:

- $X > 100$

- $\frac{X + (200 - X) + (200 - X)}{2} \geq X$

Minimizing  $f(x) = \frac{X + (200 - X) + (200 - X)}{2}$:

- Solution range:  $100 < x \leq \frac{400}{3}$
- As $f(x)$  is a linearly decreasing function, minimum occurs at $X = \frac{400}{3} â‰ˆ 133.333$.

**Q:** What if the Limited Invocation of Spirits is accompanied by two pools (e.g., Special Invocation and Crazy Invocation)?

**A:** If the Limited Pool features good heroes, prioritize Special Invocation as the secondary pool. The Crazy Pool's doubled probability boost provides diminishing returns under Dual-Pool Strategy.

| Limited Invocation of Spirits + Special Invocation of Spirits | average | max    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| X = 133                                                       | 94.2    | 133.3  |
| X = 180                                                       | 88.6    | 180.0  |

**Q:** What if a shared pity exists before executing the Dual-Pool Strategy?

**A:** Keep the shared pity zero before executing the Dual-Pool Strategy!
