;; run-statistics-4: Count the expected number of pulls to obtain a 5-Star Hero for the first time in
;; Normal Ancient Summoning.
;; NOTE:
;; 1. Since the ancient pool does not reset the pity after pulling a 5-Star Normal Hero, the sample here
;; may not necessarily represent the number of pulls for the first time a 5-Star Hero is obtained.
;; 2. The parameter 'first-only' forces the statistics to focus on the first time only.
